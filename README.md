# Molokai Color Scheme for Vim

(Forked from https://github.com/tomasr/molokai to make trivial edits.)

Molokai is a Vim port of the monokai theme for TextMate originally created by
Wimer Hazenberg.

256-Color terminals are also supported, though there are some differences with
the Gui version.

## Installation

Vim-plug:

```vim
Plug 'scott-linder/molokai'
```
